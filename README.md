# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if aliens have been contacting or interacting with earth.

## Results

This webpage can by used to view the full database of UFO sightings, or to filter the database by location, data, or shape of the UFO.

To filter your search, simply type out the filter located on the left side of the webpage, and hit return.

In the example below, I am filtering for all UFO sighting from the state of Arkansas.

This form automatically will filter the database to show the three UFO sighting from this state.

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is that in order to refresh the database, the webpage needs to be reloaded.

Two recommendations for further development outlined below:

1) Provide a "refresh" button that resets the database filters

2) Allow for multiple layer filters (when two or more filters are added)
